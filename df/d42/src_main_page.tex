The tools that can be configured and so enabled are\+:\hypertarget{src_main_page_src_subprojects}{}\section{Subprojects}\label{src_main_page_src_subprojects}
Creation and dumping of intermediate representation\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Subproject Parsers\+: provides all the available parsers, adopted to acquire the data that the tools use as input to their algorithms.
\item Subproject Graph\+: contains the definition of the graph-\/based descriptions.
\item Subproject P\+O\+L\+I\+X\+ML\+: contains the definition of a simple and easy-\/to-\/use X\+ML library.
\item Subproject \hyperlink{src_behavior_page}{Behavior\+:} contains functions to manage and to represent graphs with different granularity. In particular we can represent C\+F\+G/\+D\+F\+G/\+C\+D\+G/\+D\+D\+G/\+S\+DG for operations and C\+F\+G/\+D\+F\+G/\+Dom/\+Post\+Dom for basic blocks.
\item Subproject src\+\_\+tree\+\_\+page provides \char`\"{}\+Tree\+:\char`\"{} functions to manage and to represent the tree computed by the G\+CC compilation.
\item Subproject Frontend\+: contains the algorithms adopted to build the entire intermediate representation (both tree and graph-\/based).
\item Subproject Parsers\+: it provides backend functions to C, SystemC, V\+H\+DL, and Verilog descriptions.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Resource library and circuit representation management\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Subproject Technology\+: provides functions to manage and to represent technology information.
\item Subproject \hyperlink{src_circuit_page}{Circuit\+:} describes a generic data structure representing a circuit.
\item Subproject Wrappers\+: it provides classes to wrap commercial synthesis tools.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Development aids\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Subproject src\+\_\+algorithms\+\_\+page contains a set of useful algorithms that can be used to aid problem solution into development.
\item Subproject \hyperlink{src_ilp_page}{I\+LP} provides utilities used to solve I\+LP formulations.
\item Subproject src\+\_\+utility\+\_\+page contains some useful macros and functions. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
