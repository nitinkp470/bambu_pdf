\subsection{Detailed Description}
Non-\/\+Iterative liveness analysis for S\+SA based gimple descriptions. 

Compute the liveness sets by exploring paths from variable use (Algorithm 4 and 5). Details of the algorithm can be found in the following technical report\+:

Strict S\+SA is also known as S\+SA with dominance property because it ensures that the definition of a variable always dominates all its uses. This property can be exploited to optimize the computation of liveness sets. Our first contribution is the design of a fast data-\/flow algorithm, which, unlike traditional approaches, avoids the iterative calculation of a fixed point. Thanks to the properties of strict S\+SA form and the use of a loop-\/nesting forest, we show that two passes are sufficient. A first pass, similar to the initialization of iterative data-\/flow analysis, traverses the control-\/flow graph in postorder propagating liveness information backwards. A second pass then traverses the loop-\/nesting forest, updating liveness information within loops. Another approach is to propagate from uses to definition, one variable and one path at a time, instead of unioning sets as in standard data-\/flow analysis. Such a path-\/exploration strategy was proposed by Appel in his \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}Tiger book\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{} and is also used in the L\+L\+VM compiler. Our second contribution is to show how to extend and optimize algorithms based on this idea to compute liveness sets one variable at a time using adequate data
